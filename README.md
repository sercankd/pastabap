# _Pastabap_

_Pastabap_ is a fork of [Pasthis](https://github.com/moulecorp/pasthis)

Working demo can be found in https://abap.sercan.xyz/

I am working on adding translation of strings, for now its partly in Turkish language.

It is a pastebin written in [PHP](https://www.php.net) using
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) as database backend and
Instead of [prettify](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) to handle the syntax in original [Pasthis](https://github.com/moulecorp/pasthis), 
I've replaced it with a [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/) for better syntax highlighting.
